# Ewald-Splitting-with-Prolates

"/LAMMPS" folder contains a fork of the [LAMMPS](https://github.com/lammps/lammps) molecular dynamics software.

This fork includes custom modifications for the ESP (Ewald summation with prolate spheroidal wave functions) method.

The ESP method code modifications main contributors:
* Jiuyang Liang
* Libin Lu
* Alex Barnett
* Leslie Greengard
* Shidong Jiang

The GROMACS repository is available in [Libin's GitHub profile](https://github.com/lu1and10/Ewald-Splitting-with-Prolates).

The folders "/LysoProtein", "/Transmembrane", and "/Li-ion Electrolyte" contain the GROMACS input files for the lysozyme protein, the transmembrane bovine bc1 complex, and Li-ion aqueous electrolytes, respectively.

More data files and detailed descriptions will be available shortly. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me via email at jliang@flatironinstitute.org.
